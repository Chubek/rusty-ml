## Machine Learning with Rust

This repo, and its companion Github pages, is dedicated to everything related to Machine Learning with Rust. When I announced my decision to create this blog/repo/whatever to my friend, he sternly dissuaded me and said "Why do you so much want to be different? Just use Python!" But you see...

1- Python is type unsafe and dynamically typed. Two things that are ERROR MINES for a discipline which is entirely based on data.

2- Machine Learning with Rust might not be as glamorous as it is with Python, but it has a bright future.

And these are the only two reasons I need to spend my precious free time munching on trailmix, watching detective shows and doing ML with Rust. How about you?


#Codes

Every snippet of code is in the "Codes" branch. So the master branch is empty. The blog is housed on the "blog" branch.
